Hopsan is now available as both Flatpak and Snap packages  
[https://www.flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.hopsan.Hopsan](https://www.flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.hopsan.Hopsan)  
[https://snapcraft.io/hopsan](https://snapcraft.io/hopsan)  

```
flatpak install flathub com.github.hopsan.Hopsan
or
snap install hopsan
```

These packages run in confinement which results in some known issues, see  
[README.md#flatpak](https://github.com/Hopsan/hopsan/blob/master/README.md#flatpak)
